# ANYTLS: A Multiplexed Application-Layer Connection Protocol over TLS

# Overview

ANYTLS is a multiplexed application layer connection protocol. 

This document defines version 1 of ANYTLS.

## Terms and Definitions

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Commonly used terms in this document are described below.

- **ANYTLS:** The protocol described by this document.
- **Endpoint:** An entity that can participate in a ANYTLS connection by generating, receiving, and processing ANYTLS frames. There are only two types of endpoints in ANYTLS: client and server.
- **Client:** The endpoint that initiates a ANYTLS connection.
- **Server:** The endpoint that accepts a ANYTLS connection.
- **Frame:** A unit of structured protocol information. There are multiple frame types, each of which carries different information. Frames are contained in TLS Record Section
- **ANYTLS Connection:** Logically, ANYTLS Connection is an upgrade from TLS Connection, but in reality, ANYTLS Connection is still TLS Connection.
- **Stream:** A bidirectional channel of ordered bytes within a ANYTLS connection. A ANYTLS connection can carry multiple simultaneous streams.
- **Stream ID**: It is used to identify different streams in an ANYTLS connection.
- **Application:** An entity that uses ANYTLS to send and receive data.

This document uses the terms "ANYTLS Frame", "TLS Record", and "TCP packets" to refer to the units of the respective protocols. 

That is, one or more ANYTlS frame can be encapsulated in a TLS record, which is in turn encapsulated in an TCP packet.
